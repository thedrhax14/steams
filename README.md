# STEAMS
Following commands were tested only on Mac OS X. If someone finds commands for Windows, then please update README.md file. The project was created and developed using npm V6.8.0, node v10.15.0 and vue v3.3.0. Vue-cli was also used, but not sure what version. It is may be the same as vue.

## Project setup
Make sure you have node.js installed.
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
It only works if you have vue installed. It is recommended to use UI because it is more friendly for the beginners and just easier to manage vue project.
```
vue ui
```
However, if you like code and bash (terminal or command promopt) then check section below.

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
This may fix your life problems:) The same function available in the vue ui.
```
npm run lint
```

## Usefull notes
### Component-oriented programming
Since we are doing components, please everyone read [this](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html) and check Components in depth. I added one very simple example of it called InstalledPlugins.vue, which can be found in folders "components" and "views". Tomorrow I will finish moving complex auth and popuo components, so you could use them as examples or validation of your code.

In particular, learn how to register new components, pass data to components, reuse components in views, create new views and edit router. Don't forget the [basics](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) too.

### Practice
It is reccomended to have local project on personal machine for learning and experimentation purposes.

# STEAMS

## Project setup
Make sure you have node.js installed.
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
It only works if you have vue installed. It is recommended to use UI because it is more friendly for the beginners and just easier to manage vue project.
```
vue ui
```
However, if you like code and bash you can use these:
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
